# Vaccine-Usage-Prediction-and-TaxiFare-Amount-Prediction--by-Logistic-Regression
Vaccine Usage Prediction:

This task involves predicting the likelihood of individuals taking an H1N1 flu vaccine based on various predictor variables. These predictors may include demographic information (such as age, gender), health status indicators (e.g., presence of chronic medical conditions), behavioral factors (e.g., previous vaccination history), and socio-economic factors (e.g., income level, education).
Logistic regression, a supervised learning algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks, will be employed. The target variable for this task is binary, indicating whether an individual received the H1N1 flu vaccine or not.
The dataset includes 34 predictors along with the target variable, providing a comprehensive set of features for predicting vaccine usage.

Taxi Fare Amount Prediction:

This task involves predicting the fare amount for taxi rides based on various factors such as distance traveled, time of day, traffic conditions, pickup/dropoff locations, and possibly weather conditions.
Logistic regression, traditionally used for binary classification, will be adapted for this regression task. Although logistic regression is not typically used for regression problems, it can still be employed by binning fare amounts into categories or by using a variant like ordinal logistic regression.
The dataset for this task would include features related to taxi rides, such as distance, time, locations, and any other relevant factors affecting the fare amount.
Evaluation of the model's performance will be based on regression metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) or mean squared error (MSE).
Overall, the project involves building two logistic regression models, each tailored to its respective prediction task: vaccine usage prediction and taxi fare amount prediction. The models will be trained, evaluated, and potentially fine-tuned to optimize their performance for the given tasks.
